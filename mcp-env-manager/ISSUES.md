# MCP Environment Manager: Issues and Fixes

This document tracks the issues found during review and testing of the MCP Environment Manager package, along with their fixes and current status.

## Completed Fixes

1. **Fixed JSON Import Issues**
   - **Problem**: The TypeScript configuration with `module: "NodeNext"` caused issues with JSON imports.
   - **Solution**: Changed imports from `import { version } from '../package.json'` to using `createRequire` for JSON imports.
   - **Status**: ✅ Fixed

2. **Fixed Tool Implementation Format**
   - **Problem**: The tool implementations didn't match the expected format for the MCP SDK.
   - **Solution**: Updated all tool implementations to return the correct `CallToolResult` format with a `content` array containing text entries.
   - **Status**: ✅ Fixed

3. **Fixed Shebang Placement**
   - **Problem**: The shebang (`#!/usr/bin/env node`) was not at the beginning of the file.
   - **Solution**: Moved the shebang to the first line of the file.
   - **Status**: ✅ Fixed

4. **Fixed Type Issues**
   - **Problem**: Several TypeScript type errors, particularly with the `respond` parameter which doesn't exist.
   - **Solution**: Updated parameter signatures to use the correct `extra` parameter and fixed return types.
   - **Status**: ✅ Fixed

## Known Issues Requiring Further Work

1. **SSE Transport Implementation**
   - **Problem**: The SSE transport implementation is incomplete and doesn't work as expected.
   - **Required Fix**: Implement a proper SSE transport that can handle HTTP requests and SSE connections.
   - **Workaround**: Currently falls back to stdio transport for all modes.
   - **Status**: ⚠️ Needs Implementation

2. **Testing Infrastructure**
   - **Problem**: Testing is difficult due to the stdio-based communication.
   - **Required Fix**: Implement better testing tools or add a dedicated testing mode.
   - **Workaround**: Created a testing guide with manual testing procedures.
   - **Status**: ⚠️ Needs Enhancement

3. **Package Installation Verification**
   - **Problem**: Package installation functionality is not fully tested.
   - **Required Fix**: Add proper tests for package installation with mock packages.
   - **Status**: ⚠️ Needs Testing

4. **Configuration Watcher Verification**
   - **Problem**: The configuration watcher's ability to detect and respond to changes is not fully tested.
   - **Required Fix**: Add tests for configuration changes and watcher responses.
   - **Status**: ⚠️ Needs Testing

## Future Enhancement Ideas

1. **CLI Enhancement**
   - Add direct command-line operations for common tasks without requiring JSON-RPC.
   - Example: `mcp-env-manager create-profile MyProfile`

2. **Web Interface**
   - Add a simple web interface for managing profiles and environment variables.

3. **Integration Testing**
   - Create comprehensive integration tests with Claude Desktop and Cursor.

4. **Package Repository Management**
   - Add ability to specify custom package repositories for MCP package installation.

5. **Environment Variable Templates**
   - Support for template variables and environment-specific overrides.
