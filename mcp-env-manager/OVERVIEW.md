# MCP Environment & Installation Manager - Development Overview

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the MCP Environment & Installation Manager project for Claude Code to use as a starting point in finalizing and productionizing the codebase.

## Project Purpose

The MCP Environment & Installation Manager is a specialized Model Context Protocol (MCP) server designed to solve two key problems:

1. Managing environment variables across different MCP configurations
2. Automating the local installation and configuration of MCP servers

It provides a secure, profile-based approach to managing sensitive configuration values used by other MCP servers, while also ensuring that all required MCP servers are properly installed and configured locally.

## Current Architecture

The codebase is organized into a modular TypeScript application with the following components:

1. **Configuration Management** (`config.ts`)
   - Defines default paths for configuration files
   - Handles platform-specific paths (macOS, Windows, Linux)
   - Manages encryption keys and configuration schemas

2. **MCP Server Definition** (`server.ts`)
   - Creates the McpServer instance
   - Defines tools, resources, and prompts
   - Sets up request handlers

3. **Command-Line Interface** (`bin/mcp-env-manager.ts`)
   - Entry point for the MCP server
   - Initializes the server and transport
   - Handles process lifecycle

## Key Features To Implement

### 1. Environment Variable Management

- Profile-based environment variable storage
- Secure encryption of sensitive values
- Environment variable templating and expansion
- Profile switching and activation

### 2. MCP Installation Management

- Configuration file watching
- Local package installation
- Version management
- Auto-configuration of MCP references

### 3. Integration Features

- Coordinated profile and package management
- Unified storage and configuration
- Cross-MCP communication

## Implementation Strategy

The implementation should be completed in phases:

1. **Phase 1: Environment Management**
   - Profile creation and management
   - Environment variable storage with encryption
   - Basic MCP configuration support

2. **Phase 2: Installation Management**
   - Configuration file watching
   - Package installation and registry
   - Basic auto-configuration

3. **Phase 3: Integration & Refinement**
   - Coordinated profile and package management
   - Enhanced user experience
   - Comprehensive error handling

4. **Phase 4: Optimization & Security**
   - Performance optimization
   - Security hardening
   - Platform compatibility testing

## Development Notes

When implementing this project, consider the following:

1. **Backward Compatibility**: Ensure the implementation works with existing MCP configurations

2. **Platform Support**: Verify that all features work correctly on macOS, Windows, and Linux

3. **Error Handling**: Implement comprehensive error handling with user-friendly messages

4. **Security**: Carefully implement encryption and secure storage of sensitive data

5. **Testing**: Create unit and integration tests to verify the functionality

6. **Documentation**: Update the README and create additional documentation as needed

7. **Packaging**: Ensure the project can be easily installed and used by others

## Dependencies

The project uses the following key dependencies:

- `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk`: Core MCP SDK for server implementation
- `zod`: Schema validation for tools and configuration
- `chokidar`: File system watching for configuration files
- `crypto`: Node.js built-in module for encryption
- `conf`: Configuration storage with encryption

## Production-Ready Checklist

Before considering the implementation complete, ensure:

- [ ] All features described in the specification are implemented
- [ ] Code is properly documented with JSDoc comments
- [ ] Tests cover all critical functionality
- [ ] Error handling is comprehensive
- [ ] Security measures are properly implemented
- [ ] Performance is optimized
- [ ] README and documentation are complete
- [ ] Package is properly configured for distribution

## Conclusion

This project aims to create a comprehensive solution for managing MCP servers and their configurations, streamlining the process of working with multiple MCP servers across different projects and environments. By implementing the features outlined in this document and the accompanying specification, we will create a valuable tool for MCP developers and users.
