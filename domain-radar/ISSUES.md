# Domain Radar MCP: Issues and Fixes

This document tracks the issues found during review and testing of the Domain Radar MCP package, along with their fixes and current status.

## Current API Status

- **WhoisXML API Integration**: The server now uses WhoisXML API for domain availability checking (100 free queries/month)
- **Domain Availability**: ✅ Fully functional with WhoisXML API
- **Expiring Domains**: ⚠️ Returns mock data (WhoisXML requires data feed subscription)
- **Expired Domains**: ⚠️ Returns mock data (WhoisXML requires data feed subscription)

## Completed Fixes

1. **Fixed Project Structure**
   - **Problem**: The initial project structure didn't follow the recommended MCP standards.
   - **Solution**: Restructured the project to use the standard directory layout with proper separation of concerns.
   - **Status**: ✅ Fixed

2. **Fixed Configuration Management**
   - **Problem**: Configuration was hardcoded and didn't follow best practices.
   - **Solution**: Implemented a dedicated configuration module that supports environment variables and dotenv.
   - **Status**: ✅ Fixed

3. **Fixed Package.json Configuration**
   - **Problem**: Package.json lacked necessary fields and configurations for production use.
   - **Solution**: Added bin configuration, proper dependencies, scripts, and publishConfig.
   - **Status**: ✅ Fixed

4. **Fixed TypeScript Configuration**
   - **Problem**: TypeScript configuration needed updates for proper ES module support.
   - **Solution**: Updated tsconfig.json to use NodeNext module resolution and add necessary compiler options.
   - **Status**: ✅ Fixed

5. **Fixed Tool Implementation Structure**
   - **Problem**: Tool implementations were all in a single file without proper separation.
   - **Solution**: Created dedicated tools directory with proper modularization.
   - **Status**: ✅ Fixed

## Known Issues Requiring Further Work

1. **API Integration** (Partially Resolved)
   - **Update**: Now using WhoisXML API for domain availability checking
   - **Remaining Issues**: Expired/expiring domains still use mock data
   - **Required Fix**: Either subscribe to WhoisXML data feeds or integrate with another API that provides REST endpoints for expired/expiring domains
   - **Status**: ✅ Domain availability fixed, ⚠️ Expired/expiring needs implementation

2. **SSE Transport Support**
   - **Problem**: Server-Sent Events (SSE) transport is not fully implemented.
   - **Required Fix**: Implement proper SSE transport support for better Claude Desktop integration.
   - **Workaround**: Currently falls back to stdio transport.
   - **Status**: ⚠️ Needs Implementation

3. **Advanced Domain Analysis**
   - **Problem**: The current implementation lacks advanced domain analysis features mentioned in README.
   - **Required Fix**: Implement domain value estimation, trends analysis, and suggestion algorithms.
   - **Status**: ⚠️ Needs Implementation

4. **Comprehensive Testing**
   - **Problem**: Test coverage is currently limited to basic configuration tests.
   - **Required Fix**: Add comprehensive unit and integration tests for all tools and resources.
   - **Status**: ⚠️ Needs Implementation

## Future Enhancement Ideas

1. **Machine Learning for Domain Value Prediction**
   - Use historical domain sales data to predict domain values more accurately

2. **Domain Portfolio Management**
   - Add tools for managing multiple domains, tracking renewals, and optimizing registrar selection

3. **Domain Monitoring Alerts**
   - Implement notification capabilities for high-value domains about to expire

4. **Competitive Analysis**
   - Add tools to analyze competitor domains and suggest alternative naming strategies

5. **Integration with Popular Domain Registrars**
   - Direct integration with GoDaddy, Namecheap, and other popular registrars for seamless domain registration

6. **Domain SEO Analysis**
   - Add tools to analyze domain authority, backlinks, and SEO potential
